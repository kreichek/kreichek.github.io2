Hi, I am Kevin Reichek. I recently graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/)'s [School of Computer Science](http://scs.cmu.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Science in Statistics.

I'm broadly interested in data analytics and artificial intelligence.

Right now, in my spare time I am working through Sergey Levine's Deep Reinforcement Learning [course](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) at Berkeley.

I work as a software engineer at [Applied Predictive Technologies](http://predictivetechnologies.com/) in Arlington, VA.
