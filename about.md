Hi, I am Kevin Reichek. I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University''s School of Computer Science with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Science in Statistics.

I''m broadly interested in data analytics and artificial intelligence.

Right now, in my spare time I am working through Sergey Levine''s Deep Reinforment Learning course at Berkeley.

I work as a software engineer at Applied Predictive Technologies in Arlington, VA.
